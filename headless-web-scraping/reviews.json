A lot of bugs and problems were already posted in the Q&A section and it helped a lot. Towards the end of the course, there were a few things that were outdated and a lot of people were disappointed in the comments but for me these things helped a lot. You learn to search and find solutions on your own and this is what is required in real world. Hence, despite these issues towards the end, I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants to start learning backend development.",

    "reviewerText": "As always with Jonas's other courses like JS, HTML and CSS I understood everything he told. As an improvement, it was bit uneasy seeing the date you wrote code is 2019 in some lectures. Wished it was brand new. So can you do some update. Also can you consider incorporating lectures about Websocket, GraphQL, Testing ,Nodejs with Typescript and Deno as these where some topics I see included in another popular Nodejs course.",
